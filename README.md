# About the Game

In Hangman, players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each correct guess reveals the letter positions in the word, while incorrect guesses bring the player one step closer to being 'hanged'. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

# Features

Learning Mode: Improve your vocabulary with definitions and usage examples after each round.

Animations: On Every Wrong Input the Animation of the Hangman is played in order until the last wrong letter is typed in and on winning it shows the animation being reversed and displaying You Won! in the end.
